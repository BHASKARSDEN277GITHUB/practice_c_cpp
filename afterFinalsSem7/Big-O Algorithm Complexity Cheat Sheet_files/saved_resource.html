I agree with Luis that the table is correct and not useless but also agree with Oleksandr that it's not complete (but again disagree that it is incomplete because of the mismatch between best/average case and big-O, see Statement iii and Example (a) in the end).\n\nThe main confusion is between the terms \"case\" and \"bound\". These are orthogonal terms, and do not have any relation with each other. For example, you have a lower-bound for average-case, or upper-bound for best-case, ... (in total 9 different, correct combinations, each useful for a different use case, but --none-- has useless/meaningless information)\n\nHere are the statements in this argument:\nStatement i) \"The table is wrong in using Big-O notation for all columns\". This statement is false because the table is correct. Big-O notation does not have anything to do with the worst case, average case or the best case. Big-O notation is only a representation for a function. Let's say the best-case run time for an algorithm for a given input of size n is exactly (3*n + 1). One correct representation for this function is O(n). Therefore, writing O(n) for a best-case entry is correct.\n\nStatement ii) \"The best-case and average-case columns are correct in definition but useless/meaningless\". This statement is also false. While learning the \"average case\" (3*n + 1) as O(n) may give the impression that the run-time may even be constant, it is still not useless. This is an over-approximation of the real information. It gives the information that, given random inputs the algorithm will never run more than O(n) time. So, for different use cases it is useful. For example, if you design a system, knowing that your inputs will be random, then you can be sure that it will never take more than linear time to compute.\n\nStatement iii) \"The columns are not complete\". This statement is true since you need the exact function for completeness. E.g., you may want to compare two algorithms A1 and A2 by their best-case run-time. Let's say A1's best-case run-time is O(n) and A2's best-case run-time is O(n^2). With this information, you *cannot* conclude that, in the best case, A1 performs asymptotically better than A1. Because, for what we know from the Big-O notation is that, A2 may even be running in constant time! Further, if these were the Omega instead of the Omicron, the example is still false. For what we know from the Omegas is that they may both be running in exponential time, hence still incomparable. \nMoreover, this argument even holds for the worst-case column. If A1 is O(n) in the worst-case and A2 is O(n^2) in the worst-case, A2 could still be constant and may run faster. Again, is this information useless; no. You know the upper-bounds! If you must use something linear then A1 is your choice.\n\nHere are a few incorrect statements for an algorithm A1 with worst-case O(n) and A2 with worst-case O(n^2), and how to correct the incorrect ones:\na) \"When you run A1and A2 with their worst-case inputs, A1 would perform better asymptotically\": False, since from what we know, A2 could even be running in constant time (it's only proven to be less than or equal to O(n^2)) and A1 in n! To make this comparison we need the upper-bound for A1 and --the lower bound-- for A2, both for their worst-case. If A1's upper-bound (O(n)) is better than A2's lower bound (e.g. Omega(n logn)) then we can conclude this statement for the worst case. \n\nb) \"If you are designing a missile defense system that needs a linear-time algorithm, then A1 is the correct choice.

I agree with Luis that the table is correct and not useless but also agree with Oleksandr that it's not complete (but again disagree that it is incomplete because of the mismatch between best/average case and big-O, see Statement iii and Example (a) in the end).\u003c/p>\u003cp>The main confusion is between the terms \"case\" and \"bound\". These are orthogonal terms, and do not have any relation with each other. For example, you have a lower-bound for average-case, or upper-bound for best-case, ... (in total 9 different, correct combinations, each useful for a different use case, but --none-- has useless/meaningless information)\u003c/p>\u003cp>Here are the statements in this argument:\u003cbr>Statement i) \"The table is wrong in using Big-O notation for all columns\". This statement is false because the table is correct. Big-O notation does not have anything to do with the worst case, average case or the best case. Big-O notation is only a representation for a function. Let's say the best-case run time for an algorithm for a given input of size n is exactly (3*n + 1). One correct representation for this function is O(n). Therefore, writing O(n) for a best-case entry is correct.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Statement ii) \"The best-case and average-case columns are correct in definition but useless/meaningless\". This statement is also false. While learning the \"average case\" (3*n + 1) as O(n) may give the impression that the run-time may even be constant, it is still not useless. This is an over-approximation of the real information. It gives the information that, given random inputs the algorithm will never run more than O(n) time. So, for different use cases it is useful. For example, if you design a system, knowing that your inputs will be random, then you can be sure that it will never take more than linear time to compute.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Statement iii) \"The columns are not complete\". This statement is true since you need the exact function for completeness. E.g., you may want to compare two algorithms A1 and A2 by their best-case run-time. Let's say A1's best-case run-time is O(n) and A2's best-case run-time is O(n^2). With this information, you *cannot* conclude that, in the best case, A1 performs asymptotically better than A1. Because, for what we know from the Big-O notation is that, A2 may even be running in constant time! Further, if these were the Omega instead of the Omicron, the example is still false. For what we know from the Omegas is that they may both be running in exponential time, hence still incomparable. \u003cbr>Moreover, this argument even holds for the worst-case column. If A1 is O(n) in the worst-case and A2 is O(n^2) in the worst-case, A2 could still be constant and may run faster. Again, is this information useless; no. You know the upper-bounds! If you must use something linear then A1 is your choice.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Here are a few incorrect statements for an algorithm A1 with worst-case O(n) and A2 with worst-case O(n^2), and how to correct the incorrect ones:\u003cbr>a) \"When you run A1and A2 with their worst-case inputs, A1 would perform better asymptotically\": False, since from what we know, A2 could even be running in constant time (it's only proven to be less than or equal to O(n^2)) and A1 in n! To make this comparison we need the upper-bound for A1 and --the lower bound-- for A2, both for their worst-case. If A1's upper-bound (O(n)) is better than A2's lower bound (e.g. Omega(n logn)) then we can conclude this statement for the worst case.\u003c/p>\u003cp>b) \"If you are designing a missile defense system that needs a linear-time algorithm, then A1 is the correct choice. And if you choose A2 you are doomed\": First part is correct but second part is wrong. Kind of beating a dead horse here, but we need A2's lower-bound to make this conclusion.\u003c/p>","isSpam":false,"isHighlighted":false,"points":0},{"isFlagged":false,"forum":"bigocheatsheet","parent":1089479244,"author":{"username":"disqus_KPUtFh6iVC","about":"","name":"Bob Foster","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"url":"","isAnonymous":false,"rep":1.466726,"profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/disqus_KPUtFh6iVC/","reputation":1.466726,"location":"","isPrivate":false,"isPrimary":true,"joinedAt":"2013-08-24T16:54:04","id":"69562974","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/disqus_KPUtFh6iVC.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/6956/2974/avatar32.jpg?1377363246"},"isCustom":true,"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/disqus_KPUtFh6iVC.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/6956/2974/avatar92.jpg?1377363246","large":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/disqus_KPUtFh6iVC.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/6956/2974/avatar92.jpg?1377363246"}}},"media":[],"isDeleted":false,"isApproved":true,"dislikes":0,"raw_message":"I believe you are correct.
